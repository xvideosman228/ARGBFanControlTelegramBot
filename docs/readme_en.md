## Telegram-bot for controlling ARGB lights 


This is a project, that interacts with Arduino
which connected to a PC via USB and to which connected a chain of ARGB-Coolers

*Libraries I used:* Aiogram (for making GUI for Telegram-bot), pyserial (which uses for interacting with Arduino), dotenv (for stashing the bot's token)
